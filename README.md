# Emergent Sort Service

The basic idea of this project is, the clients will send their datas to our server and the Emergent Sort Service will find the better solution for sort the informations. For example, an university they have a enroled students list and want get sort for any attribute (name, course, enroled code, final grade).

The Emergent Sort Service will be able of to sort and to mensurable the performance of all sort options and self-optimize for get the best response time to client. If necessary, the service can use both local or parallel processing. And, in the optimize process, the mecanism will use determinated metrics as time and performance cost, lining up with the concept green computing.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* [Dana] - Programming language
* [PAL]  - Framework 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
